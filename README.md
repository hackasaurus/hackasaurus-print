This is a simple static web page that uses the Flickr API to generate a
printable "souvenir" of a hack created using the [Web X-Ray Goggles][webxray].

It was created for use at the [Toronto Mini Maker Faire][faire] on May 7,
2011.

All graphics are SVG whenever possible, to allow for printing at maximum
resolution. The page was designed with [Failbook][] in mind; any screenshots
with different resolutions are automatically scaled to fit on a printed
8.5x11" page.
